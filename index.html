<h3>ELEMENTARY SCHOOL !</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Funny Memory:</strong> When I was in like 5th grade my mom had bounght me this jogging pants and jacket that was matching from target.It was a hot pink lepord animmal print (at that time I did'nt have no sense of style). My school had uniform so the only time I could wear it was on dress down days. So I wore it on that day and everyone thought I was wearing pajamas to school and I was so embarresed that I took off the jacket part and just wore the pants with shirt underneath. I never wore that outfit againnn!</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong> First Freinds:</strong> I don't remember all my friends that I made in elementary school, but my best freind is still my friend and we have been friends sine kindergartden. We were in the same classroom every year, coincidentally until now. She goes to Westinghouse high school and we meet every other Wedensday at target.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Interests:</strong> I used to be on the swim team when I was younger. I was on there for 5 years, and the weird thing was that I never learned how to dive properly.  I recently quit 2 yrs ago because I didn't like it. I also liked fashion design and I know how to sew. </li>
</ul>

    <hr>
    <ul> 
    <li> A <i>physical</i> goal that I have this year and probably every year is getting all A's on my report card because I wanna go to the best colleges. I will acheive these goals by working hard and studying ... probably. </li>
    <!--shows italic font-->
    <br>
    <li> An <i>emotional</i> goal I have for myself is to not stress myself about school because this school is stressful and gives too much homework. I can't acheive these goals cause I don't want bad grades. </li>
    <br>
    <li> A <i>social</i> goal that I have is to make more friends. I can acheive this by being more social.</li>
